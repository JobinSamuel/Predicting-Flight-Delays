# Predicting-Flight-Delays

This project focuses on predicting flight arrival delays using machine learning models. By analyzing historical flight data, we aim to predict and understand the key factors that contribute to flight delays. The project leverages multiple machine learning algorithms to assess performance and provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency in the airline industry.

#  Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to predict flight arrival delays based on various factors such as departure time, flight number, day of the week, taxi-out time, and the airports involved. The project is divided into the following key components:

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess flight data, handling missing values, and selecting relevant features for prediction.
Use techniques like forward filling and value replacement to ensure the dataset is ready for training.
Model Development:

# Implement several machine learning models to predict flight delays:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Bayesian Ridge
Gradient Boosting Regressor

# Model Evaluation:
Assess model performance using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R2 Score, and Median Absolute Error.
Compare models and select the best-performing one for future predictions.
Actionable Insights:

Identify and highlight key factors contributing to flight delays, such as:
Departure time and taxi-out duration significantly affecting arrival delays.
Day-of-week trends impacting delays, aiding in better scheduling decisions.
These insights can help optimize flight operations, resource allocation, and improve customer experience.
Data Visualization:

Visualize the correlation between features using heatmaps to help in understanding the relationships between different factors affecting delays.

#  Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementing machine learning models.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating models.
